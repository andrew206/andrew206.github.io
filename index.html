              <p>Translation enabled doctors to work across borders. The non-profit organization “Doctors Without Borders” was awarded the Nobel Peace Price in 1999. They have traveled across the world to heal people living in conflict zones. But in medical practices, a mistranslation can cost as much as 71 million dollars. In 1980, Willie Ramirez’s doctor misinterpreted his condition as “intoxicated” instead of “poisoned” due to mistranslation. This misinterpretation left Willie Ramirez quadriplegic, but he received a malpractice settlement of $71 million.</p>

              <p>There is a secret world of movie translations. Without the people who translate these movies, Marvel’s box office will report less than a third of its current earnings. In fact, some of these movies even have cooler titles after the translation. We recommend you trying to watch a translated movie in another language to really experience translation.</p>

              <p>Most Ph.D. students have to learn a foreign language even if they are in a STEM field. This is because they often encounter academic texts that are in different languages. Academics collaborate with each other across the world. Translation enables this collaboration. For example, if you want to be a mathematician, you should start learning German or Russian now, those are the two languages commonly used in math texts.</p>

              <p>Investors do not have to learn a new language every time they invest in a project from a new country. Translation allows them to monitor the foreign market. However, sometimes these translations are unreliable. Panic in the world's foreign exchange market led the U.S. dollar to plunge in value after a poor English translation of an article by Guan Xiangdong of the China News Service zoomed around the Internet. Sometimes even a tone difference in the translated text can change the mind of many investors.</p>
